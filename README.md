### Lj here ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for stopping by!

I collaborate with Prof. Arman Cohan at Yale University on NLP research!

I am currently excited in improving faithfulness of language models, and getting them to work in contexts where data is scarce.
Check out my research and projects <a href="https://ljyflores.github.io/">here</a>!
