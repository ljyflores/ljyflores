### Lj here ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for stopping by!

I collaborate with Prof. Jackie Cheung at MILA + McGill University on NLP research!
I am currently excited by active learning, and how we can get machine learning models to work in contexts where data is scarce.
Previously, I worked with Prof. Arman Cohan and Prof. Drago Radev at Yale on tasks in summarization and simplification.
Check out my research and projects <a href="https://ljyflores.github.io/">here</a>!
